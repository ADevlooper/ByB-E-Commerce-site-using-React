- `@reduxjs/toolkit: ^2.9.2` - Redux toolkit for state management
- `react-redux: ^9.2.0` - React bindings for Redux

## Current State Management Approach
The project uses React Context API through `CartContext.jsx` for managing cart state:

### CartContext Features
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` hook for cart state
- **Persistence**: Automatically saves cart to localStorage
- **Operations**:
  - `addToCart()`: Adds products with quantity and options
  - `removeFromCart()`: Removes items by ID
  - `updateQuantity()`: Updates item quantities
  - `clearCart()`: Empties the cart
  - `getOrderSummary()`: Calculates totals, tax, shipping, discounts

### Context Usage
- Provider wraps the entire app in `App.jsx`
- Components access cart state via `useCart()` hook
- No Redux store, reducers, or actions needed

## Benefits of Current Approach
1. **Simplicity**: Fewer dependencies and boilerplate
2. **React Native**: Context API works seamlessly with React Native
3. **Performance**: Direct state updates without middleware
4. **TypeScript Ready**: Easy to add TypeScript support
5. **Local Storage**: Automatic persistence without additional setup

## Alternatives Considered
- **Redux Toolkit**: Would require store setup, slices, and actions
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management library
- **Recoil**: Facebook's state management solution
- **Context API**: Current choice - simple and sufficient

## Migration Notes
- No code changes were needed as Redux was never implemented
- Cart functionality remains unchanged
- All components using `useCart()` hook continue to work
- Package size reduced by removing unused dependencies

## Testing Recommendations
- Verify cart add/remove/update functionality
- Test localStorage persistence across browser sessions
- Check order summary calculations
- Ensure no console errors related to missing Redux

## Future Considerations
If the application grows significantly and requires:
- Time-travel debugging
- Complex state synchronization
- Server-side rendering support

Consider re-evaluating Redux or other state management solutions at that time.
